## 🏆 Model Performance

We trained and evaluated five different regression models to find the best one for predicting income levels. Here's how they stacked up:

| Model | R² Score | Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Random Forest** | **0.9205** | **13398.98** |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.9153 | 13830.85 |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 0.8961 | 15315.96 |
| Linear Regression | 0.8882 | 15890.05 |
| SVM | -0.0140 | 47856.98 |

The **Random Forest** model emerged as the champion, with the highest R² Score and the lowest RMSE, making it our chosen model for the web application.

## 💡 How It Works

This project follows a systematic and well-structured machine learning workflow:

1.  **Data Loading:** The "salary.csv" dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Data Cleaning:**
    *   Missing values are identified and removed.
    *   Outliers in numerical columns are detected and removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
3.  **Feature Engineering:**
    *   Categorical features like 'Gender', 'Education Level', and 'Job Title' are converted into numerical representations using one-hot and label encoding.
4.  **Model Training:** The cleaned dataset is split into training and testing sets, and five different regression models are trained on the training data.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** The performance of each model is evaluated on the testing set using R² Score and RMSE.
6.  **Model Saving:** The best-performing model (Random Forest) is saved to a file named `best_model.pkl`.
7.  **Web Application:** A Streamlit application (`app.py`) is created to:
    *   Load the saved model.
    *   Provide a user-friendly interface for single-instance predictions.
    *   Allow users to upload a CSV file for batch predictions.
